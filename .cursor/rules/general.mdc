# General

- Use Bun as package manager and runtime
- Use AI SDK when building AI-specific functions
- Prefer functional programming patterns unless classes make sense
- Use UK English spelling (colour, initialise, etc.)
- Use our internal RPC pattern when defining services
- Always use snake_case for service names
- Prefer smaller functions and files over large classes
- Use ESM imports/exports
- Focus on readability and maintainability
- Functions should always have try/catch blocks and proper types

## AI

- Use Gemini 2.5 Flash or OpenAI 4.1-mini models
