# Orin - Planning & Documentation Standards

## Project Planning
- The **`/plan` folder is the source of truth** for all project planning
- All planning documents should be in `/plan` folder
- Use naming convention: `{feature-name}.md` for planning documents

## Orin Brand Guidelines
- Always refer to the project as **"Orin"** (not Vibeplexity)
- Use Orin's symbolic meaning in documentation:
  - **Light**: Clarity, guidance, illumination of digital complexity
  - **Pine Tree**: Strength, reliability, natural growth and adaptation
- Brand promise: *"Orin illuminates your digital life, transforming chaos into orchestrated harmony"*

## Document Structure
Planning documents should follow this hierarchy:
1. **vision-document.md** - Strategic foundation and business vision
2. **technical-architecture.md** - System design and implementation details
3. **implementation-roadmap.md** - Timeline and development schedule
4. **{service}-integration.md** - Service-specific integration plans

## Documentation Style
- Use **UK English spelling** throughout
- Include concrete examples and code snippets
- Provide clear success metrics and acceptance criteria
- Reference actual files using `@filename` syntax when helpful

## Planning Document Template:
```markdown
# {Feature Name} - Implementation Plan
