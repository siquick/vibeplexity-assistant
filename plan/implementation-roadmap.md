## 🚨 Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High-Priority Risks

#### 1. Google API Quota Limits
```bash
Risk: Exceeding Google Calendar API quotas
Probability: Medium | Impact: High

Mitigation:
- [ ] Implement aggressive caching (5-15 minute TTL)
- [ ] Use batch API requests where possible
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff
- [ ] Monitor quota usage daily
- [ ] Request quota increase from Google if needed
```

#### 2. OAuth2 Security Vulnerabilities
```bash
Risk: Security breach in authentication flow
Probability: Low | Impact: Critical

Mitigation:
- [ ] Implement PKCE for all OAuth flows
- [ ] Use secure state parameters
- [ ] Validate all redirect URIs
- [ ] Implement proper CSRF protection
- [ ] Regular security audits
```

#### 3. Token Management Issues
```bash
Risk: Token expiration or corruption
Probability: Medium | Impact: Medium

Mitigation:
- [ ] Implement robust token refresh logic
- [ ] Add token validation before each use
- [ ] Implement graceful re-authentication flow
- [ ] Monitor token success rates
- [ ] Implement token health checks
```

### Medium-Priority Risks

#### 4. Database Performance
```bash
Risk: Slow database queries affecting UX
Probability: Medium | Impact: Medium

Mitigation:
- [ ] Implement proper database indexing
- [ ] Use connection pooling
- [ ] Add query performance monitoring
- [ ] Implement query optimization
- [ ] Consider read replicas for scale
```

#### 5. Natural Language Parsing Accuracy
```bash
Risk: Poor date/time parsing leading to wrong events
Probability: Medium | Impact: Medium

Mitigation:
- [ ] Use proven NLP libraries (chrono-node)
- [ ] Implement confirmation flows for ambiguous dates
- [ ] Add extensive test cases for edge cases
- [ ] Provide clear feedback on parsed dates
- [ ] Allow manual date override
```
